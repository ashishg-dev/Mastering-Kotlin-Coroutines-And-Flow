19 - What are some common use cases for Kotlin Coroutines in Android development?

Kotlin Coroutines offer several powerful capabilities for handling common tasks in Android development, including:

Network Requests - Perform asynchronous network calls.
Database Operations - Execute database queries and insertions on background threads.
File I/O - Perform file reading and writing operations in a non-blocking manner using Dispatchers.IO.
UI Updates - Update the UI after performing asynchronous tasks.
Parallelizing Tasks - Run tasks concurrently and wait for results.
Delays and Timeouts - Handle delays and timeouts without blocking the main thread.
Periodic Tasks - Schedule recurring tasks at fixed intervals.
Job Cancellation and Cleanup - Cancel jobs and clean up resources when needed.

By using coroutines, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code and avoid the pitfalls of callback-based asynchronous programming.
