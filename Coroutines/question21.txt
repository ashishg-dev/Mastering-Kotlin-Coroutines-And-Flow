21 - How do you optimize coroutine performance in Kotlin?

Choose the Right Dispatcher: Use Dispatchers.Default for CPU-bound tasks,
Dispatchers.IO for I/O-bound tasks, and Dispatchers.Main for UI updates.

Minimize Blocking: Use non-blocking functions like delay() instead of Thread.sleep(), and avoid unnecessary join() calls.

Structured Concurrency: Use coroutineScope or supervisorScope to manage coroutines with well-defined lifetimes.

Limit Concurrency: Use semaphores or custom thread pools (with newFixedThreadPoolContext) to control concurrent tasks.

Use async for Concurrent Tasks: Leverage async/await for concurrent but independent tasks.

Avoid Creating Too Many Coroutines: Manage the number of coroutines you create,
and consider using a Channel or other mechanisms for batching tasks.

Caching and Memoization: Cache results to avoid redundant computation or network calls.

Flow for Streams: Use Flow to efficiently handle streams of data.

Proper Cancellation: Cancel unnecessary or long-running coroutines when theyâ€™re no longer needed.
