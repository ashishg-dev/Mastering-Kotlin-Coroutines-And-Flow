What is the difference between yield() and Thread.sleep() in coroutines?

yield(): It is a suspending function that tells the coroutine dispatcher to give up the current thread and allow other coroutines to run.
It doesn't block the thread but allows the scheduler to switch to another coroutine that may be ready to run.

Thread.sleep(): It is a blocking function that halts the entire thread for the specified duration, preventing any other tasks from executing on that thread.

While Thread.sleep() can cause performance issues by blocking the thread, yield() provides a cooperative suspension mechanism that does not block the thread.
